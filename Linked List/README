# 🔗 Singly Linked List in Java

## 📘 What is a Linked List?

A **Linked List** is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes. Each node contains:
- A `data` field storing the value
- A `next` reference pointing to the next node in the sequence

Unlike arrays, linked lists do **not** store elements in contiguous memory blocks, which allows for efficient insertions and deletions.

## 🛠️ Linked List Representation in Java

```java
// Node class
class Node {
    int data;
    Node next;

    Node(int data) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = null;
    }
}
🖼️ Visual Representation
For a linked list: 10 -> 20 -> 30 -> null

Each node is:

Copy
Edit
[10 | o ] -> [20 | o ] -> [30 | null]
Each block contains data | next.

💡 Real-World Use Cases
Application	Description
Music Playlist	Each song points to the next
Browser History	Back/forward navigation using linked nodes
Undo/Redo Feature	Actions stored in a linked list
Task Scheduling (OS)	Processes in a queue
LRU Cache	Efficient eviction using a doubly linked list

📈 Advantages
✅ Dynamic size (no need to pre-define size)

✅ Efficient insert/delete at head/tail (O(1) if pointer is known)

✅ Great for memory-constrained systems

⚠️ Disadvantages
❌ No random access (O(n) traversal)

❌ Extra memory for pointers

❌ Not cache-friendly like arrays

🧪 Sample Usage
java
Copy
Edit
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LinkedList list = new LinkedList();
        list.append(10);
        list.append(20);
        list.append(30);

        list.printList();  // Output: 10 -> 20 -> 30 -> null
    }
}
📚 Summary
Linked Lists are foundational data structures in computer science, widely used in real-world applications where dynamic memory allocation, efficient insertions/deletions, and flexibility are key.
