## 🛠️ What You'll Learn

### 📦 Data Structures
| Structure | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| 🔹 Arrays & Strings | Basic containers for data |
| 🔹 Linked Lists | Dynamic data storage |
| 🔹 Stacks & Queues | LIFO & FIFO structures |
| 🔹 Hashing | Key-value storage (HashMap, HashSet) |
| 🔹 Trees | Hierarchical data (Binary Trees, BSTs) |
| 🔹 Heaps | Priority queues (Min/Max heap) |
| 🔹 Graphs | Nodes and connections (BFS, DFS) |
| 🔹 Tries | Prefix trees for strings |
| 🔹 Union-Find | Disjoint Set (for cycle detection, etc.) |
